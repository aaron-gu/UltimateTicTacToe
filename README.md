# Ultimate TicTacToe
*Play Ultimate TicTacToe, a highly strategical game of TicTacToe involving strategy and "checkmates" much like chess!*

![example gameplay](ExampleGameplay.gif)

The goal of Ultimate TicTacToe is to complete three tictactoe boards to win the entire game. Boards are won like in normal tictactoe and each move is similar to a normal tictactoe move, except that it will send your opponent to the corresponding board on the whole grid, as indicated by a yellow highlight.

If a player is sent to a completed board, then he/she can move to **any** open position. Using this strategy wisely in the endgame can force your opponent into situations where their only move is to send you to a completed board, allowing you to easily claim boards for your victory.

I built the game using Java Swing. You can download/clone this as a Java Project and jump right into playing the game!
